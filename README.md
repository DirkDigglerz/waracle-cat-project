## üß™ Challenge Context

This project was built as a response to a Front-End Technical Challenge. The brief was to:

* Upload new cat images
* View uploaded images in a responsive layout
* Toggle favourite/unfavourite status
* Vote cats up or down
* Display a live score (upvotes ‚àí downvotes)

Additional expectations included professional styling, responsive design, validation, error handling, and sensible use of third-party tools.

> üïí **Suggested timescale**: 3‚Äì4 hours
> ‚úÖ **Actual time spent**: \~5‚Äì6 hours

Extras like animations, toast notifications, optimistic updates, and modular state handling were added where time allowed.
